            spirit of the Terms of Services or the Services, at its sole discretion. PFCGaming also reserves the right

            take any action it deems appropriate as a result, which may include forbidding you access to the Services,

            to
            keep your password safe and never to give your Account information to anyone else. If another user you share

            responsible for that purchase.</p>
        <h4>3.4 License Term</h4>
        <p>The term of the licenses granted to you under this Terms of Services shall commence on the date you accept

            or
            access to the services or any portions thereof if PFCGaming suspects or if you have failed to comply with
            any of
            the Terms of Services, for any suspected or actual illegal activity, improper use of the Services, with or
            without any notice to you. Such actions may result in the loss of your account, information, persona,
            benefits and in-game purchases. PFCGaming is not and will not be held responsible for any information,
            persona,
            rankings, benefits and losses incurred, and is under no obligation to compensate you for any of this.</p>

            particular
            game or part of the Services at any time, at which point your license to use the Services or a part thereof
            will be automatically terminated. In such event, PFCGaming shall not be required to provide refunds,
            benefits or
            other compensation to users in connection with such discontinued or terminated Services. Such actions may
            also result in termination of your Account, disabling of your access to the Services or any part thereof,
            including any content that may have or was in the process of being submitted.</p>

            items referred to collectively as “Virtual Items”); and (c) other goods or services (“Merchandise”) within
            the Services for your personal and non-commercial entertainment. You are only allowed to purchase Virtual
            Items from PFCGaming or its authorized partners through the Services, not in any other way.</p>
        <p>You understand that PFCGaming has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate
            Virtual
            Items and may revoke your access to them at any time and for any reason, with or without notice. PFCGaming
            shall
            have no liability to you or any Third Party in the event that PFCGaming exercises any such rights. You have
            no
            claim, right, title, proprietary or ownership interest in any of the Virtual Items regardless of any
            consideration paid for those virtual items.</p>
        <p>Except when explicitly authorized by PFCGaming, (i) transfers of Virtual Items to other user accounts are
            strictly
            prohibited; (ii) outside of the Services, you may not buy or sell any Virtual Items for “real world” money
            or otherwise exchange items for value; and (iii) PFCGaming does not recognize any such purported transfers
            of
            Virtual Items or the purported sale, gift or trade in the “real world” of anything that appears in the
            Services. Any attempt to do any of the foregoing is in violation of these Terms of Services and will result
            in an automatic termination of your rights to use the Virtual Items and may result in termination of your
            Account. All Virtual Items are forfeited if your Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, or if
            PFCGaming discontinues providing the Services.</p>
        <p>You agree that you will not assert or bring any claim against PFCGaming, its affiliates, directors, officers,
            employees, agents or licensors relating to (i) a claim that you own any Virtual Items; or (ii) a claim for
            an alleged monetary value of Virtual Items lost upon deletion or suspension of your account or modification,
            termination or expiration of these terms.</p>
        <h4>5.2&nbsp;Fees, Refunds and Return Policy</h4>
        <p>All sales through the Service are final. You acknowledge and agree that any applicable fees and other charges
            (including, without limitation, virtual items) are not refundable in whole or in part. You are fully liable
            for all charges to your account, including any unauthorized charges. PFCGaming does not issue any refunds or
            offer any exchanges of any products purchased on or through the Services.</p>
        <p>IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU
            WILL NOT BE REFUNDED, RECEIVE MONEY, OR BE OTHERWISE COMPENSATED FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS OR OTHER GAME
            ASSETS WHEN THE SERVICES ARE TERMINATED FOR ANY REASON AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER
            SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</p>
        <p>PFCGaming may, at any time, revise or change the pricing, availability, specifications, content, descriptions
            or
            features of the game or any products sold through the Services. The inclusion of any products through the
            Services at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products will be available at any other
            time. All such changes will be effective immediately upon posting of such new product prices to the
            Services.</p>
        <h3>6.&nbsp;Updates to the Services</h3>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that PFCGaming may update the Services and the games you have installed on your
            computer
            or mobile device with or without notifying you.</p>
        <h3>7.&nbsp;Third-party Services</h3>
        <p>The Services or/and the games may include links to Third-party services and/or the Third-party services may

            “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS FOR YOUR USE, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
            INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE
            AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AND THOSE ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. PFCGaming DOES NOT WARRANT
            THAT

            WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE GAME OR THE SERVICES ARE
            FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>
        <h3>10. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>to the maximum extent permitted by law, PFCGaming SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
            CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF REVENUES,
            LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (HOWEVER SUCH LOSSES ARE
            QUALIFIED), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICES OR THE SERVICES ITSELF, WHETHER
            BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT PFCGaming HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
            POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. PFCGaming SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO
            PFCGaming
            IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICES IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU
            FIRST ASSERT A CLAIM. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID ANYTHING TO PFCGaming DURING SUCH
            TIME
            PERIOD, YOUR SOLE REMEDY (AND PFCGaming’ EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY) FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH PFCGaming IS TO STOP
            USING THE
            SERVICES AND CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of
            liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of these disclaimers and limitations may not apply
            to you. To the extent that PFCGaming may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit
            its
            liability as set forth herein, the scope of such warranty and the extent of PFCGaming’ liability shall be
            the
            minimum permitted under such applicable law. In particular, nothing in these Terms of Services shall affect
            the statutory rights of any consumer or exclude or restrict any liability for death or personal injury
            arising from any negligence or fraud of PFCGaming.</p>
        <h3>11.Indemnity</h3>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold PFCGaming harmless from any claim, demand, damages or other losses,
            including reasonable attorneys’ fees, asserted by any Third Party resulting from or arising out of any
            breach by you of this Terms of Services. PFCGaming reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the
            exclusive
            defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify PFCGaming, and you agree to
            cooperate
            with PFCGaming’ defense of these claims. PFCGaming will make reasonable efforts to notify you of any such
            claim,
            action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.</p>
        <p>You agree that the provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your Account(s) or of the
            Services.</p>
        <h3>12.&nbsp;Dispute Resolution and Applicable Law
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</h3>
        <p>If a dispute arises between you and PFCGaming, PFCGaming strongly encourages you to first contact PFCGaming
            directly to seek
            a resolution by opening a help ticket directly in-game via the help section or contact PFCGaming at
            help@pfcgaming.com.</p>
        <p>You agree that all disputes between you and PFCGaming shall be governed by the laws of Turkey by a court
            located
            in Istanbul without regard to conflict of law provisions, and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of
            such court.</p>
        <h3>13.&nbsp;No Class Actions</h3>
        <p>You and PFCGaming can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. BY AGREEING TO THESE
            TERMS OF
            SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A CLASS ACTION AND CAN ONLY BRING CLAIMS
            AGAINST PFCGaming IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.</p>
        <p>That means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>neither you nor PFCGaming may bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action,
                consolidated
                action or representative action;</li>
            <li>the arbitrator or court cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case and cannot
                preside over any consolidated, class or representative arbitration proceeding (unless you and PFCGaming
                both
                agree to change this); and</li>
            <li>the arbitrator’s or court’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact the person who
                brought the claim, not other users of the Services, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with
                other users.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>14.&nbsp;Severability</h3>
        <p>If any portion of these Terms of Services or of the Privacy Policy is found illegal or unenforceable, in
            whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
            ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting
            the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the
            remaining provisions of the terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.</p>
        <h3>15. Assignment</h3>
        <p>PFCGaming may assign or delegate these Terms of Services and/or the Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to
            any
            person or entity at any time, with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or
            obligations under the Terms of Services or Privacy Policy without PFCGaming’ prior written consent, and any
            unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is ineffective.</p>
        <h3><br> 16. Supplemental Policies</h3>
        <p>PFCGaming may publish additional policies related to specific services such as forums, contests or loyalty
            programs. Your right to use such services is subject to those specific policies and these Terms of Services.
        </p>
        <h3>17.&nbsp; Entire Agreement</h3>
        <p>The Terms of Services and Privacy Policy contain the entire understanding of you and PFCGaming and supersede
            all
            prior understandings of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof, whether electronic, oral
            or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, between you and us with respect
            to the Services.</p>
        <h3>18.&nbsp;No Waiver</h3>
        <p>The failure of PFCGaming to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms of
            Services or the Privacy Policy or failure to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a
            waiver or relinquishment of PFCGaming’ right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or
            any
            other instance.</p>
        <p>The express waiver by PFCGaming of any provision, condition or requirement of these Terms of Services or the
            Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision,
            condition or requirement.</p>
        <p>Except as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms of Services, no representations, statements,
            consents, waivers or other acts or omissions by PFCGaming shall be deemed a modification of these Terms of
            Services nor legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed
            officer of PFCGaming.</p>
        <h3>19.&nbsp;Equitable Remedies</h3>
        <p>You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made under these Terms of Services to PFCGaming are
            of a
            unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm PFCGaming and that cannot be
            replaced
            by monetary damages alone, so that PFCGaming shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief
            (without
            the obligations of posting any bond or surety or proof of damages) in the event of any breach or
            anticipatory breach by you.</p>
        <p>You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief or to enjoin or restrain the
            operation of the Services or the games, exploitation of any advertising or other materials issued in
            connection therewith or exploitation of the Services or any content or other material used or displayed
            through the Services and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages (if any), limited by
            Sections 5.2 and 11.</p>
        <h3>20.&nbsp;Force Majeure</h3>
        <p>PFCGaming shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its
            reasonable
            control, including, without limitation, any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or
            causes beyond PFCGaming’ control such as natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil
            or
            military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel,
            energy, labor or materials.</p>
        <h3>21.&nbsp;Partnership</h3>
        <p>You agree that your use of the Services does not constitute any joint venture, partnership, employment or
            agency relationship between you and PFCGaming as a result of this Agreement.</p>
        <h3>22.&nbsp;Notices</h3>
        <p>PFCGaming may notify you via postings on <a href="https://PFCGaming.com">PFCGaming.com</a>, on app-store
            pages of the
